Model:
A sine wave signal with 3x3 output.
The output is computed as 

Output=Offset+Amplitude*sin(Frequency*time+Phase)

Offset, Amplitude, Frequency, Phase are 3x3 matrices.
The default value of these variables (in column major) are
Amplitude=[1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
Frequency=[1,1,1;1,1,1;1,1,1];
Phase=[0,0,0;0,0,0;0,0,0]
Offset=[1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
